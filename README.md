**Tech Stack:**  
Python 3.11+, Flask, LangChain, ChromaDB, Sentence-Transformers, DeepSeek (OpenRouter), markdown2, HTML/CSS

**How it works:**  
1. Upload PDFs  
2. Documents are chunked and embedded  
3. Ask questionsâ€”answers are generated using RAG and LLM  
4. Sources are cited for every answer

## Setup
1. Clone the repo and enter the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd ai-rag-agent
   ```
2. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Add your OpenRouter API key to `.env`:
   ```
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```
5. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

## Usage
- Upload one or more technical PDFs.
- Ask questions about the documents.
- Get context-aware answers with source citations.

## Folder Structure
- `app.py` â€” main Flask app
- `pdf_loader.py` â€” PDF loading utility
- `templates/` â€” HTML templates (UI)
- `uploads/` â€” (ignored) uploaded files
- `.env` â€” (ignored) API keys

## Deployment
- Ready for HuggingFace Spaces, Streamlit Cloud, AWS, or Azure
